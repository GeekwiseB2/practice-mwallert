        <h3>I've always been interested in computers even when I was very young. After high school I went straight to Fresno State and pursued a computer engineering degree. Three years or so into my degree I had to drop out and become self supportive. After a few dead-end jobs I really wanted to get back to school. My step father told me about gitwise and I decided to give it a try. I liked the first class and am looking forward to learning more!</h3>
